# Implementation:

### Q) What libraries did you add to the frontend? What are they used for?
I used

* `react` to build the UI ðŸ™‚
* `react-test-renderer` to test react components
* `redux` and `react-redux` for state management
* `redux-logic` and `redux-logic-test` to manage side effects (like network requests) and write tests for them
* various skyscanner's `backpack` components / styles avoiding reinventing the wheel and making the development process faster
  * `bpk-component-button`
  * `bpk-component-card`
  * `bpk-component-icon`
  * `bpk-component-infinite-scroll`
  * `bpk-component-spinner`
  * `bpk-component-text`
  * `bpk-mixins`
  * `bpk-stylesheets`
* `classnames` to dynamically concat class names

### Q) What is the command to start the server?
From the root folder

 * `npm run client` to run client
 * `APIKEY=<key> npm run server` to run server
 * `APIKEY=<key> npm run server:watch` to run server using nodemon
 * `npm run server:mock` to run server with mock data
 * `npm run server:mock:watch` to run server with mock data using nodemon

# General:

### Q) How long, in hours, did you spend on the test?
I spent around 24 hours
* 9 hours on Saturday 14/09/2019
* 9 hours on Sunday 15/09/2019
* around 6 hours on tuesday 17/09/2019

### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?
##### A) Additional Features
Having more time I'd have liked to add
* filtering / sorting functionality
* adding a drawer to show itinerary details

##### A) Improvements
* Use re-reselect to improve performances (after analyzing if actually needed)
* In some cases the implementation doesnâ€™t match 100% the design in terms of
  * Spacing
  * Font size
  * This is because I tried to use BPK style / components as much as possible without customizing them too much
* Split selectors in multiple files - one for each part of the data (itinerary, legs, query, etc)
* Add `env` management for URLs and API key
* Add more tests for the UI and e2e tests
* Expose 3rd party components (BPKs) to the application through custom components, so that migrating to a different library would be easier (but this make more sense for a long term large application ðŸ™‚)
* Use typescript all across the project instead of just Proptypes in components



### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?
I'm quite proud about the redux implementation / tests,
even if I didn't have enough time to
* write a exhaustive set of tests for the selectors
* use re-reselect to improve performances

I'm quite proud about the UI also, that I think is quite close to the design given;


### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?
##### A) Most Difficult
About difficulty, maybe the main challenge was understanding the data structure coming from the API and thinking
about how to organize data on the front-end;

the goal was to keep it as simple as possible;

at the end I decided to use a front-end application state quite similar to the API data structure,
putting the complexity of aggregating data for the UI components into `Redux Selectors`.

This way I avoided duplicating several times the same chunks of data in the application state.

##### A) Spending more time
I think that implementing all the redux part

* reducers (including tests)
* actions (including tests)
* redux logics (including tests)
* selectors (including tests)
* connectors

was the most time consuming part


### Q) How did you find the test overall? If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test or our API, we'd love to hear them.
I'm a great Skyscanner user, so interacting with the real APIs and rebuilding a small part of it was really fun;
furthermore, the instructions are really well detailed.

Maybe the only thing that is not 100% clear to me is how important it is to be as fast as possible to finish the challenge.

I know that instructions say 'Feel free to spend as much or as little time as youâ€™d like', but I've also been told that you consider how fast the solution comes,
so it was not easy to find the perfect balance between quality and fast pace.
